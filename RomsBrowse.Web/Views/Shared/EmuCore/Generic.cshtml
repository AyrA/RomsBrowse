            For now this works best in chromium based browsers (chromium, chrome, edge).
            Firefox has some audio playback issues but emulation works fine otherwise.<br />
            Apart from keyboard controls, most standard game controllers are supported.
            The emulator registers the controller automatically as soon as you press the first key on it.<br />

                For games that support saving your progress,
                game memory is automatically uploaded to the server whenever it detects a change.
                The progress is then automatically restored when you run the game for the next time.<br />
                When you save the game, wait for the SRAM timer above to reset to zero
                before closing your browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                Games that do not save your progress can still be saved and restored.
                To do so, select "Save State" from the emulator menu.
                The state is automatically restored the next time you run the game,
                or whenever you use the "Load State" menu option.<br />
                When you save the game, wait for the save state timer above to reset to zero
                before closing your browser.
            </p>
